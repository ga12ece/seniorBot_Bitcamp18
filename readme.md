### Inspiration ###

Our parents are all overseas and mostly above 60s of age. Most of the time we would like to share
multiple pictures through either emails or social media or share our thoughts about some new tech 
device. Currently, we would try to show our parents how to set up the accounts by calling them on
 the phone or in video calls. However, the explanatory process takes a lot of time and is quite 
 confusing due to the multiple account setting-up steps and without visual description. This chat bot 
helps making the explanation process more time efficient and more intuitive to follow, therefore, narrowing
the bridge between generations and promoting the up-to-date technology knowledge to senior
citizens. 
 

### What it does ###

The user types in questions or request to the Senior bot, our bot replies with list of possible answers
either in step-by-step of how to open an email account, or the bot gives general description of the new technology
given the input images uploaded by the user via the computer vision packages (Microsoft Azure). The bot also gives options for the user to talk directly 
to a real person by transfering the request to a near-by expert through a text. The user can locate
the expert's location (Esri mapping GPS localization) and arrange the meeting to answer the user's questions

### How we built it ###

We designed the platform using website development in Visual Studio ESP.NET with project overview and team member. 
The Senior bot is developed using the computer vision packages through Microsoft Azure. The mapping and 
localization were done in Arcgis developer Javascript API from Esri.

### Challenges we ran into ###

The most challenges we got is to how to use high technology to remove technology's barrier of senior citizens. Through out 36 hours, we had learnt how to 
build a chatbot, integrate computer vision API to recognize high tech items for senior citizens and build a map to locate nearby technican experts for 
senior citizens.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of ###

We accomplish a functioned platform using natural language processing and some new localization developer resources 
that we have never exposed before. 

### What we learned ###

We learned to develop and integrate multiple language and API platforms together using Microsoft Azure 

### What's next for SeniorBot ###

We will further train and develop our bot to extend its topics to other tasks such as booking flights,
 or expand to other new tech device searching. Moreover, we want to establish 
a connection database among the near-by experts so they can track each other schedules and marked down
status of each cases to speed up the helping process.
